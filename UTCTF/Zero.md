For the Zero challenge we were given a text file called **zero.txt**

Once you download the file you will notice that it all just appears as lorem ipsum filler text. But you might notice, just as the challenge description says the file size is bigger than it should be.

The title of the file is a hint towards the solution. Zero alludes to **zero width characters**.

Now that we have a lead you can use an online steganography tool such as [this](https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html) one on github.

to find the hidden characters which turns out to be the flag.

Flag: utflag{whyNOT@sc11_4927aajbqk14}
