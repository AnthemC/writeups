This challenge gives you a wav file and tells you that it is a **SSTV** transmission.

Once downloading the file I did a little research and looked around to figure out what SSTV means and found out that its a method of transmitting images over HAM radio.

I downloaded a tool called RX-SSTV. With this tool you choose the RX option which we know is Martin 1 from the challenge description. Then you play the audio while the program is open and the image will appear in the box on the left once the audio is over.
